# General Behavior

- Do not be prescriptive with implementation details unless explicitly asked. Focus on the desired user-facing outcome or visual behavior.
- If the user says "fix X", analyze the root cause rather than applying a superficial patch.

# Code Quality Standards

1. **Simplicity:** prioritize standard library patterns and existing project conventions over custom logic.
2. **Readability:** Code must be self-documenting. Use descriptive naming. Avoid complex one-liners.
3. **Modularity:** - Files should be short and focused.
